Design Implementation Coding Challenge

1. Clone the repository to your localhost: 'git clone https://bitbucket.org/bbarber-snap/snapfinance-coding-challenge.git'
2. Review the design mockup named "Mock Merchant Cart - Mockup.png". 
3. Review the assets in the /images folder.
4. Using best practices, implement the design using html/css. A default.html file has been created as a starting point.
5. Using basic javascript, allow for quantities to be updated and have the prices reflect the update both next to the item and on the total. 
6. Using basic javascript, when the "Checkout with Snap!" button is pressed, cut the shipping cost in half each time. Minimum shipping cost is $5. 
7. Other clickable items on the page do not need to have any functionality written for them.


What Snap! is looking for: 

1. A correct solution to the mockup implementation (meets requirements listed above). - Note: This does not need to be written for any platforms other than desktop at the given size. 
2. Organization of the implementation. 
3. Easy to read and be understood by another developer. 
4. **When you have completed the challenge, simply commit your changes to the repository (master branch) and send an update via email to: bbarber@snapfinance.com **
